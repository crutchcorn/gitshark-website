Certain\r\n        functions of the app will require the app to have an active\r\n        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided\r\n        by your mobile network provider, but OceanBit LLC\r\n        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full\r\n        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t\r\n        have any of your data allowance left.\r\n      </p> <p class=\"bodyPTag\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p> <p class=\"bodyPTag\" data-children-count=\"0\">\r\n      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you\r\n      should remember that your terms of the agreement with your\r\n      mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may\r\n      be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for\r\n      the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or\r\n      other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting\r\n      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data\r\n      charges if you use the app outside of your home territory\r\n      (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If\r\n      you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re\r\n      using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have\r\n      received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\r\n    </p> <p class=\"bodyPTag\" data-children-count=\"0\">\r\n      Along the same lines, OceanBit LLC cannot always take\r\n      responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to\r\n      make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of\r\n      battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,\r\n      OceanBit LLC cannot accept responsibility.\r\n    </p> <p class=\"bodyPTag\" data-children-count=\"0\">\r\n      With respect to OceanBit LLC’s responsibility for your\r\n      use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to\r\n      bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is\r\n      updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties\r\n      to provide information to us so that we can make it available\r\n      to you.

However, you promise to always\r\n      accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may\r\n      also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of\r\n      it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.\r\n      Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the\r\n      rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;\r\n      (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it\r\n      from your device.\r\n    </p>\r\n      <p class=\"bodyPTag\" data-children-count=\"0\"><h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2></p>\r\n      <p\r\n        data-children-count=\"0\" class=\"bodyPTag\">\r\n        We may update our Terms and Conditions\r\n        from time to time.
